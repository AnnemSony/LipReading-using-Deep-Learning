## Overview
Lip reading, also known as speech reading, involves understanding spoken words by visually interpreting the movements of the lips, face, and tongue. This project aims to provide a deep learning solution for lip reading, enabling the transcription of silent videos into text.

## Features
- **Character-Based Vocabulary:** Uses a set of characters including alphabets, punctuation, and numbers.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for feature extraction and sequence modeling.
- **TensorFlow Implementation:** Built using TensorFlow and Keras, providing easy integration and deployment.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
